# Anki flashcard generation from latex templates

This is a small python script to generate flashcards for the flashcard program Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/) from a tex file based on the templates you can find in the latex folder. 
Please note that the script is tailored to these templates. It will most likely not work with your tex files.
As of now, there is only a template for writing math documents. However, I will try to provide more templates in the near future whenever I need one. If you have any ideas, please feel free to text me.

## 1. Installation
As it's more of a useful script I want to be able to execute quickly, I haven't created a docker container or something similar for it. You can just download the script and execute it (see 2. for further explanation).
It was developed using Python 3.9.11. Make sure to have the requirements installed as described in the associated file.

## 2. Usage

## 3. Current limits of usage

## 4. Bugs and future ideas
As already mentioned in the introduction for latex templates, feel free to text me whenever you have a good idea for the project or come up with a feature that is currently not available but should be.
This is a project I am doing in my free time, so I might not find the time to integrate your ideas straightaway but I'll make sure to come back to them when I have time.
The same goes for bug reports. Please create an issue for it which involves a detailled error description and also steps to reproduce the issue. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible
