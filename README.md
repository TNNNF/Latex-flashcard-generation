# Anki flashcard generation from latex templates

This is a small python script to generate flashcards for the flashcard program Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/) from a tex file based on the templates you can find in the latex folder. 
Please note that the script is tailored to these templates. It will most likely not work with your tex files.
As of now, there is only a template for writing math documents. However, I will try to provide more templates in the near future whenever I need one. If you have any idea, please feel free to text me.

## 1. Installation
As it's more of a useful script I want to be able to execute quickly, I haven't created a docker container or something similar for it. You can just download the script and execute it (see 2. for further explanation).
It was developed using Python 3.9.11. Make sure to have the requirements installed as described in the associated file.
